# ðŸŽ¯ Audio Effects Player
The aim of this test project is to gain hands-on experience in developing an interactive audio playback and effects controller using SwiftUI and AVFoundation within the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. The project focuses on building a custom audio engine capable of applying real-time sound effects such as pitch, speed, reverb, and delay, while providing a visually dynamic user interface. Topics covered include integrating AVAudioEngine for low-level audio manipulation, synchronizing playback state and progress through MVVM, designing custom SwiftUI sliders and visualizers for interactive control, and creating a smooth, responsive user experience with precise animation and state updates.

## ðŸš€ Functionality
<p>1 - Integrate an audio playback engine using AVAudioEngine and AVAudioPlayerNode.</p> 
<p>2 - Allow users to load and play audio files with real-time control over playback state (play, pause, stop).</p> 
<p>3 - Implement adjustable audio effects including pitch, playback rate, reverb, and delay.</p> 
<p>4 - Display a responsive visualizer that animates dynamically based on the current audio level.</p> 
<p>5 - Provide intuitive slider controls for effect intensity, playback progress, and volume adjustment.</p> 
<p>6 - Show real-time updates of playback duration and current time within the interface.</p> 
<p>7 - Use SwiftUIâ€™s MVVM architecture to manage playback state, effect parameters, and UI synchronization.</p> 
<p>8 - Design a clean, interactive UI with smooth animations and transitions for an enhanced user experience.</p>

## ðŸ’¯ Concepts Utilised
